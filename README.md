# Software Engineering Final Project
Capstone Project </br></br>
For our project, we created a website for a 'Fortnite: Battle Royale' club to match yourself with people who play the same Game Type as you. </br></br>
You can either log in or create an account and once logged in just pick a Game Type and find team members!</br>
